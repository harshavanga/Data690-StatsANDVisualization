2. tableau
3. looker

#### Programming languages
1. Python
2. R
3. Julia

#### Steps involved
1. Data extraction
2. Data cleaning
3. Data wrangling
4. Analysis
5. Action

Python libraries for Data Analysis
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. numpy
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn.

## Part 2
1. Loaded sales data to the jupyter/colab notebook and cleaned. 
2. Libraries like matplotlib and seaborn are used for visualization.

## Part 3
1. Here we learned about how a cell works in jupyter notebook and the execution of code in the cell.
2. Also learned to read data and save it in various formats.

## Part 4
1. Learned about numpy library and its importance.
2. We also learned numpy arrays, matrices slicing, array types, indexing and numpy statistical functions.

## Part 5
1. Learned more about Pandas one of the most important libraries of Python. 
2. And comparision of its data structure and frame to spreadsheets or BigData DFs.

## Part 6
1. Learned to deal with data inconvinience like missing data and data cleaning.
2. Usage of various functions like isnull(), notnull(), dropna(), unique(), duplicated(), drop_duplicated().

## Part 7
1. Here we learned how to import data from other sources.
2. Multiple ways to parse the input data.

## Part 8
1. This part all about the outline of the topics discussed above.
2. Also learned basic syntax, functions, operations.
