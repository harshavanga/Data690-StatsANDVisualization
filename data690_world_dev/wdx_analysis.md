# Is an educated society equivalent to a healthy society?

In recent times of covid, we have seen countries imposing many regulations to reduce the spread of the coronavirus among people. There have also been various reactions to these regulations in various countires. Keeping in mind the differences in population, access to healthcare facilities and awareness, it is understandable that these differences occur. A particular factor that could affect the dynamics of a pandemic is the education level of the population. I am interested in knowing whether an educated population would make better decisions and co-operate better during such a crisis. 

### DATA:
The data is collected from the world development explorer website(https://www.worlddev.xyz/). The topics chosen include: Education and Health. 
The indicators chosen are:
1. Literacy rate, adult total (% of people ages 15 and above) (Education):  This indicator is used to understand the education level of the society.
2. Cause of death, by communicable diseases and maternal, prenatal and nutrition conditions (% of total) (Health):  This is used to indicate the effect of communicable diseases in the society. 
3. Educational attainment, at least completed primary, population 25+ years, total (%) (cumulative) (Education): This is also used to measure the education level of the society. 

**Time period**: 2010 - 2020

**Countries chosen**: G20 Group of countries

#### What is the relationship between literacy rate and deaths caused by communicable diseases?

I use a scatter plot to study the relation between the literacy rate and the deaths caused by communicable diseases. It is seen that sub-saharan africa has the highest number of deaths due to communicable diseases and also shows lowest literacy rate. There seems to be a negative correlation between the literacy rate and deaths due to communicable diseases. There are definitely other factors that affect including access to better healthcare and vulnerability to communicable diseases.

#### What is the relationship between percentage of people with primary education and deaths caused by communicable diseases?

Percentage of total population that has received atleast primary education is another indicator for education levels in the society. This plot also shows a similar trend as there is a negative correlation observed. As the percentage of educated people in the society increases, there seems to be lesser deaths due to communicable diseases.

It is not very evident from the plots that the education levels in correlated with the spread of communicable diseases. In general we see that the education attainment percentage is more in the US than in the sub-saharan africa.

#### How do these trends change over time?

The deaths due to communicable diseases seems to be high in the sub-saharan africa and south asia. However, this seems to decrease over a span from 2010 to 2019. Literacy rate for all the regions seems to increase in this time span. Therefore, this might mean that there is no causality between the literacy rate and the spread of communicable diseases.

It is astonishing to see that south asia has a literacy rate that is drastically low when compared to the other regions. Sub-saharan african countries show more deaths than other countries despite higher literacy rates that are increasing with time.

### Conclusion:

From these plots, we can infer that there is some correlation between deaths due to communicable diseases and education level in the society. However, deaths can depend on a lot of factors such as the country's population, heathcare facilities, regulations/steps introduced by the government, access to vaccine sand so on. If data on spread rate of communicable diseases or duration of prevelance of such diseases or frequency of such occurances can act as better communicable diseases in the society.
